**Problem Statement**

Insurance providers must precisely estimate individual health insurance costs to determine appropriate premiums. Traditional approaches typically depend on general actuarial tables and historical averages, which may overlook subtle individual differences. Utilizing machine learning allows insurers to generate more personalized and accurate cost predictions, resulting in more competitive pricing strategies and improved risk assessment.
